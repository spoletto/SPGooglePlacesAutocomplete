SPGooglePlacesAutocomplete
===============

SPGooglePlacesAutocomplete is a simple objective-c wrapper around the [Google Places Autocomplete API](https://developers.google.com/places/documentation/autocomplete). The API can be used to provide autocomplete functionality for text-based geographic searches, by returning Places such as businesses, addresses, and points of interest as a user types. SPGooglePlacesAutocomplete also provides support for converting Place results into CLPlacemark objects for easy mapping with MKMapView.

How To Use It
-------------

### Requirements
SPGooglePlacesAutocomplete requires a deployment target >= iOS 5.0.

### Installation
1. Link your project against the CoreLocation framework.
2. Copy the following files to your project:
    * SPGooglePlacesAutocompleteUtilities.h/.m
    * SPGooglePlacesAutocompleteQuery.h/.m
    * SPGooglePlacesPlaceDetailQuery.h/.m
    * SPGooglePlacesAutocompletePlace.h/.m
3. (Optional) If you would like to utilize the provided sample view controller for searching and mapping Places, link your project against the MapKit framework and copy the following files to your project:
    * SPGooglePlacesAutocompleteViewController.h/.m/.xib
    * locateButton(@2x).png
    * location(@2x).png
4. Open SPGooglePlacesAutocompleteUtilities.h and replace `kGoogleAPIKey` with your Google API key. You can find your API key in the [Google APIs Console](https://code.google.com/apis/console).

### Performing Queries

Instantiate a new SPGooglePlacesAutocompleteQuery and fill in the properties you'd like to specify.

``` objective-c
# import "SPGooglePlacesAutocompleteQuery.h"

...

SPGooglePlacesAutocompleteQuery *query = [SPGooglePlacesAutocompleteQuery query];
query.input = @"185 berry str";
query.radius = 100.0;
query.language = @"en";
query.types = SPPlaceTypeGeocode; // Only return geocoding (address) results.
query.location = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(37.76999, -122.44696);
```
    
Then, call -fetchPlaces to ping Google's API and fetch results. The resulting array will return objects of the SPGooglePlacesAutocompletePlace class.
	
``` objective-c
[query fetchPlaces:^(NSArray *places, NSError *error) {
    NSLog(@"Places returned %@", places);
}];
```
    
If you need to update the query (for instance, as the user types), simply update the appropriate properties and call -fetchPlaces again. Any outstanding requests will automatically be cancelled and a new request with the updated properties will be issued.

### Resolving Places to CLPlacemarks

The Google Places Autocomplete API will return the names of Places that match your query. It will not, however, return lat-long information about these results. SPGooglePlacesAutocomplete handles this by resolving Place results to placemarks. Simply call -resolveToPlacemark on a SPGooglePlacesAutocompletePlace:

```objective-c
[query fetchPlaces:^(NSArray *places, NSError *error) {
    SPGooglePlacesAutocompletePlace *place = [places firstObject];
    if (place) {
        [place resolveToPlacemark:^(CLPlacemark *placemark, NSString *addressString, NSError *error) {
            NSLog(@"Placemark: %@", placemark);
        }];
    }
}];
```

When searching for "geocode" (address) Places, the library utilizes CLGeocoder to geocode the address. When searching for "establishment" (business) Places, the library will automatically ping [The Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/documentation/#PlaceDetailsRequests) to fetch the details needed to geolocate the business.

### Sample Code

For an example of how to use SPGooglePlacesAutocomplete, please see the included example project. Be sure to replace `kGoogleAPIKey` with your Google API key!
